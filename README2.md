## 3. Detailed Findings

✅ [CSP Specific] - Content Security Policy Related Only
### Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Severity:** Medium\
**Confidence:** High

**Description:**\
The application does not include a `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) HTTP header. This header helps prevent various injection attacks such as **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** by specifying which sources the browser should trust to load content (e.g., scripts, styles, images).

**Affected URL:** <http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my>

**Business Impact:**\
Without a CSP, modern browsers will load JavaScript, stylesheets, images, and other resources from **any origin**. This increases the risk of malicious content being injected or loaded from untrusted sources --- especially dangerous if the app is vulnerable to reflected or stored XSS.

**Recommendation:**\
Implement a strict but functional Content Security Policy that defines the allowed sources for different types of content (e.g., `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`). This significantly reduces the impact of XSS and similar attacks by **limiting what gets executed in the browser**.

**OWASP Reference:**\
<https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Content_Security_Policy>



#### 🛠️ Remediation Steps for Developers

**Approach:** Use [`spatie/laravel-csp`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-csp) to enforce a CSP via middleware in Laravel.

**Step 1: Install CSP package**

`composer require spatie/laravel-csp`

This package simplifies the process of adding CSP headers by allowing policy-based definitions.


**Step 2: Publish the configuration file**


`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Csp\CspServiceProvider"`

This generates the config file:\
📄 `config/csp.php`


**Step 3: Create a custom CSP policy**\
Create this file:\
📄 `app/Csp/CustomPolicy.php`


```
php
namespace App\Csp;
use Spatie\Csp\Policies\Policy;
use Spatie\Csp\Directive;
use Spatie\Csp\Keyword;

class CustomPolicy extends Policy
{
    public function configure()
    {
        $this
            ->addDirective(Directive::DEFAULT_SRC, [Keyword::SELF])
            ->addDirective(Directive::SCRIPT_SRC, [Keyword::SELF, 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com'])
            ->addDirective(Directive::STYLE_SRC, [Keyword::SELF, 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'])
            ->addDirective(Directive::IMG_SRC, [Keyword::SELF, 'data:']) // allow base64 images
            ->addDirective(Directive::CONNECT_SRC, [Keyword::SELF]);
    }
}
```


> This policy restricts most resource loading to the same origin (`'self'`), with specific exceptions (e.g., CDNs).


**Step 4: Register your policy in the config**\
Open `config/csp.php` and set the custom policy:

php

`'policy' => App\Csp\CustomPolicy::class,`


**Step 5: Register the middleware**\
In `app/Http/Kernel.php`, register the middleware globally by adding:

php


`\Spatie\Csp\AddCspHeaders::class,`

to the `$middleware` array.

This middleware will automatically inject the `Content-Security-Policy` header into every HTTP response.


**Expected Result:**\
When visiting any route, your app should respond with a CSP header like:

`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'`

---

### Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

**Severity:** Medium\
**Confidence:** Medium

**Description:**\
The page response does not include any protection against **clickjacking** --- a form of attack where the web page is embedded inside a hidden or transparent iframe on a malicious site. The attacker tricks users into clicking something they didn't intend to (e.g., "Delete", "Pay", or "Submit").

**Affected URL:** <http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my>

**Business Impact:**\
Without anti-clickjacking protection, your app can be embedded into another site using an `<iframe>`, potentially leading to unauthorized actions triggered by user clicks, especially on sensitive components like buttons or forms.

**Recommendation:**\
To prevent this, restrict iframe embedding by either:

-   Using the legacy `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header

-   Or using the modern and CSP-based `frame-ancestors 'none'` directive

> ✅ Since CSP is already being used (via Spatie), we recommend enforcing iframe protection through `frame-ancestors`.

**OWASP Reference:**\
<https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking>


#### 🛠️ Remediation Steps for Developers

**Approach:** Add the `frame-ancestors` directive using the same custom CSP policy.

**Step 1: Update `app/Csp/CustomPolicy.php`**\
Add the following directive in the `configure()` method:

`$this->addDirective(Directive::FRAME_ANCESTORS, [Keyword::NONE]);`

> This directive tells the browser **not to allow the page to be embedded** in any `<iframe>`, effectively blocking all clickjacking attempts.

Optional:\
If your application legitimately needs to be embedded (e.g., in your own domain), you can use:

`$this->addDirective(Directive::FRAME_ANCESTORS, ["'self'"]);`

**Step 2: No further steps required**\

The middleware is already active from the CSP setup. The new directive will be included in the existing `Content-Security-Policy` header automatically.

**Expected Result:**\
Response header now includes:

`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';`

- This prevents the page from being displayed in any iframe, stopping clickjacking.

###  X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

**Severity:** Low\
**Confidence:** Medium\
**Affected URL:** `http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my`


#### Description:

The application does not include the `X-Content-Type-Options` HTTP header. Without it, browsers are allowed to perform MIME-type sniffing, potentially interpreting files as a different MIME type than declared.


#### Business Impact:

If an attacker uploads a file with a misleading extension (e.g., `.txt` or `.jpg`) but with malicious JavaScript inside, and the browser "sniffs" and treats it as a script, it could lead to **script execution in the wrong context** --- increasing the risk of XSS and client-side attacks.



####  Recommendation:

Set the following HTTP header on all responses:


`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

This prevents the browser from guessing the MIME type, forcing it to follow the server-declared `Content-Type`.


**OWASP Reference:**\
🔗 <https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#x-content-type-options>


### 🛠️ Remediation in Laravel

#### Step 1: Create Middleware

`php artisan make:middleware AddSecurityHeaders`

File generated at:

`app/Http/Middleware/AddSecurityHeaders.php`


#### Step 2: Add the Header Logic



```
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class AddSecurityHeaders
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        $response = $next($request);

        // Prevent MIME-type sniffing by browser
        $response->headers->set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');

        return $response;
    }
}
```


#### Step 3: Register the Middleware Globally

In `app/Http/Kernel.php`, add to the `$middleware` array:


`\App\Http\Middleware\AddSecurityHeaders::class,`


#### ✅ Result:

Every response will now include:

`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

-You can verify this by inspecting HTTP response headers in browser dev tools → **Network tab → Headers**.

2.
###  Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set

**Severity:** Low\
**Confidence:** High\
**Affected URL:** `http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my`



####  Description:

The application does not return the `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) HTTP header. This header is used to tell browsers that the site should only be accessed over **secure HTTPS connections**, and to prevent any attempts to downgrade to HTTP.



#### Business Impact:

Without the HSTS header:

-   Users might connect over **insecure HTTP** if they manually type the URL or click a non-HTTPS link.

-   This leaves users vulnerable to **SSL stripping attacks**, where attackers intercept and downgrade the connection to plaintext.



####  Recommendation:

Send the following header with **all HTTPS responses**:

`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`

-   `max-age=31536000` = 1 year

-   `includeSubDomains` = applies to all subdomains

-   `preload` = allows the domain to be added to browser preload lists (optional but recommended)

**OWASP Reference:**\
🔗 <https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#strict-transport-security>


###  Remediation in Laravel

This fix should only apply to **HTTPS connections**. So make sure your site is already using HTTPS (with a valid SSL certificate) before enforcing HSTS.


#### Step 1: Reuse or Extend Existing Middleware

If you've already created the `AddSecurityHeaders` middleware (from the previous `nosniff` fix), just **add** the following line:

`$response->headers->set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');`

So your updated `handle()` method becomes:

```
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
{
    $response = $next($request);

    $response->headers->set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
    $response->headers->set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');

    return $response;
}
```

> ⚠️ Optional: You can wrap it in a condition to apply only when HTTPS is used:

```
if ($request->isSecure()) {
    $response->headers->set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');
}
```

#### Step 2: Middleware Already Registered

As long as your `AddSecurityHeaders` middleware is registered globally in `app/Http/Kernel.php` under `$middleware`, you're good to go:


`\App\Http\Middleware\AddSecurityHeaders::class,`


#### Result:

Once implemented, HTTPS responses will include:

`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`

-You can verify this in browser dev tools or with tools like [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/).

### 🛡️ Server Leaks Version Information via 'Server' HTTP Header

**Severity:** Low\
**Confidence:** High\
**Affected URL:** `http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my`


#### 📄 Description:

The application exposes the underlying **web server type and version** via the `Server` HTTP response header. For example:

`Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Ubuntu)`

This header is automatically sent by most web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) unless explicitly disabled.


####  Business Impact:

Disclosing the server type and version makes it easier for attackers to:

-   **Fingerprint** the application stack

-   Identify known vulnerabilities specific to that version

-   Target automated exploits based on the server version


####  Recommendation:

**Suppress or obfuscate** the `Server` header in your web server configuration (not in Laravel).


### 🛠️ Remediation (Web Server Level)

####  If you're using Apache:

Edit your Apache configuration (e.g., `apache2.conf` or a relevant `.conf` site file):

1.  Disable server signature and server tokens:


`ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens Prod`

This will make the `Server` header look like:

`Server: Apache`

Or if you want to remove it completely, use a reverse proxy or security module (see below).

2.  Restart Apache:

`sudo systemctl restart apache2`


#### ✅ If you're using Nginx:

Edit your `nginx.conf` file or site config:

`server {
    ...
    server_tokens off;
}`

Then reload Nginx:

`sudo nginx -s reload`

To fully remove or mask the header, consider using a reverse proxy like **Cloudflare**, or **mod_headers** (Apache) / **headers_more** (Nginx) modules.

### 🛡️ Server Leaks Information via `X-Powered-By` HTTP Header

**Severity:** Low\
**Confidence:** Medium\
**Affected URL:** `http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my`


#### 📄 Description:

The application includes the `X-Powered-By` HTTP response header, which reveals internal details about the technology stack, such as the PHP version:

`X-Powered-By: PHP/8.2.9`

This header is typically sent by the PHP engine (or other language runtimes) unless explicitly disabled.


####  Business Impact:

Revealing the technology version and platform exposes the application to:

-   **Targeted attacks** based on known vulnerabilities for that specific PHP version or framework.

-   Easier fingerprinting for automated scanners and botnets.


####  Recommendation:

Disable the `X-Powered-By` header entirely to prevent technology leakage.


### 🛠️ Remediation Steps (PHP & Laravel)

Laravel itself doesn't add this header. It's sent by PHP and needs to be turned off in the **php.ini** configuration.


#### Step 1: Locate your `php.ini` file

This file is usually found at:

-   `/etc/php/8.x/apache2/php.ini` (for Apache)

-   `/etc/php/8.x/fpm/php.ini` (for Nginx + PHP-FPM)

You can confirm the location by running:

`php --ini`


#### Step 2: Disable `X-Powered-By` in `php.ini`

Find this line:

`expose_php = On`

Change it to:

`expose_php = Off`


#### Step 3: Restart your web server

Depending on what you're using:

`# Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2`

`# Nginx + PHP-FPM
sudo systemctl restart php8.x-fpm
sudo systemctl reload nginx`


#### Result:

After this, the `X-Powered-By` header will be removed from all HTTP responses.

You can verify it via browser dev tools or cURL:

`curl -I http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my`

You should no longer see:

`X-Powered-By: PHP/8.2.9`

🍪 [Cookie Security]
###  Cookie with SameSite Attribute None  
**Severity:** Low  
**Confidence:** Medium  
**Description:**  
Cookies are set with `SameSite=None` which may expose them to cross-site request forgery attacks.  
**Affected URL:** http://studentrepo.iium.edu.my  
**Business Impact:**  
Could lead to CSRF attacks if cookies are sent cross-site without secure validation. 

**Recommendation:**  
Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` or `Strict` depending on your application's requirements.  
**OWASP Reference:** https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/SameSite
